## How to access StaffTrack

corner of the screen, then selecting "Profile".

### Availability

### Two Factor Authentication

This allows you to add additional security to your account. You can enable this by clicking on your name in the top
right corner of the screen, then selecting "Profile" and then "Two Factor Authentication". We use Google Authenticator for 2FA. It is important that you keep your 2FA codes secure as resetting them can be a lengthy process that requires contacting your line manager and technical support.

### Browser Sessions
This section shows you the browser and device that you are currently logged in on. You can log out of all sessions by clicking the "Log out of other browser sessions" button. This can be useful if you dont have immediate access to all devices you have logged in on.

## Dashboard
The dashboard is the first thing you see on logging in. It shows you your tasks that require action, your upcoming shifts and any messages from your line manager.

## Tasks
Tasks are actions that you need to complete. They can be added by your line manager or by the system. You can view your tasks by clicking on the "Tasks" link in the top menu. By clicking on a task you can view more information about it and its status. From this task view you are able to see what is required for you to do to complete the task. If the task requires verification, it may be "Awaiting Verification" until your line manager has verified it.

Some tasks involve e-signing documents. These will be sent to you by our secure document processor "Signable". You will receive an email from Signable with a link to the document. You will need to follow the link and sign the document. If you have any issues with this process, please contact your line manager.

Some tasks are required for you to be added to the rota. You will not be able to be added to the rota until these tasks are completed, so **it's important that you complete all your tasks as soon as possible.**

You will receive a weekly roundup of any tasks that require action. This will be sent to the email address you used to sign up to StaffTrack.
